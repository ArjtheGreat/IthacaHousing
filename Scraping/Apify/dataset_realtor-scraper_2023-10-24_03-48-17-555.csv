This is apartment 1 (first floor) in a 4-unit building overlooking Cascadilla Creek. It is 4 blocks from the Ithaca Commons. This is a quiet, one-way street with tons of character. This apartment will be available November 15, 2023 for a 12 or 18-month lease. No pets allowed.All utilities (heat, electric, water, sewer) are included. In-unit washer and dryer. Near the bus route.One dedicated off-street parking space is available. If you do not need the parking space, rent will be discounted by $25/month and we will rent the parking space separately.This is an older apartment with an incredible, central location. We are in the process of doing some renovations and also fully repainting it. However, it will not be 100% updated. The price is based on this compromise of some sprucing up and full repainting, some updates, but not everything. However, you can't beat the location for being walkable and right downtown on a beautiful street. The photos are of things in process. The bathroom ceiling is being replaced and the kitchen cabinets are being repainted with new hardware - but those two rooms are really under constructions, hence no pictures. The project will be done by the move-in date of Nov 15, and we don't mind showing you the apartment now if you are able to visualize the finished product.Other tenants are quiet and respectful of neighbors.Terms: Security deposit of $1225 due at signing of the lease. First month's rent due prior to move-in. First month's rent will be prorated depending on move-in date, with full month's rent due on the first of the month after that.We ask all interested parties to complete a basic application with references. There is no charge to complete the application. After we review the application, we can schedule a showing. After you have had the chance to see the apartment, you will be able to finish the application process and pay for a credit and background check. The credit and background check is a one-time, nonrefundable fee of $39 (which goes directly to the third-party platform, not to us).We are owner managers of this property and aim to be responsive and available when maintenance issues arise.Please complete the application by clicking Apply to this listing from this page","apartment",,"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/121-Cascadilla-Ave-Apt-1_Ithaca_NY_14850_M98395-53811","1910",,
