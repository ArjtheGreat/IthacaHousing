# Ithaca Housing: Finding the Best Bang per Buck

Hi! This is the repository for the Ithaca Housing project in the [Cornell Data Journal](https://www.cornelldatajournal.org/) (Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 Semesters).

## Project Abstract

This project aims to explore the housing prices in Ithaca, or potentially beyond. We will analyze housing prices over space and time, evaluating key factors (e.g., transportation, access to shops, parks), and potentially building a multivariable regression model. From this, we can evaluate where or which options are the best. Specifically, we will consider the comparison between on or off-campus options, especially assessing whether on-campus housing prices are fair. Tools we are planning to use include ArcGIS and Python (via pandas/geopandas).
