This house is just a 10 minute FLAT walk (without hills!) to Cornell\'s Architecture School and Arts Quad and a 3 minute walk to the Jessup @Triphammer TCAT bus stop. It\'s also just a 13 minute walk to the Ag Quad. Arrive on campus on time for class without breaking a sweat. It is also just an 8 minute walk from the pool and gym at Helen Newman. This location is perfect for people who want to live in a quiet neighborhood close to Cornell University and also have a large yard to enjoy. Off-street parking spaces are rented out just behind the house. You can roast s\'mores with your friends outside in the fall around the shared propane fireplace. Relax on the bluestone patio on comfy outdoor furniture and BBQ on the grill. There are shared laundry machines right inside the house basement. Heat and water are already included in the rent, so you don\'t have to worry about those bills!

Want a large bedroom with hard wood floors just a 5 minute FLAT walk from Cornell's North Campus? Rent this 3 bedroom apartment and you will have no hills to climb to get to campus! The Cornell College of Architecture, Art and Planning is just a 10 minute walk from the house, and the Cornell Ag Quad is a 12 minute walk from the 207 Kelvin Place. Arrive on campus on time for class without breaking a sweat. If you want to sweat, the pool and gym of Helen Newman are just a 9 minute walk away from the house.

Just a 3 min drive up to Cornell and 5 to ithaca college. This upper unit comes with a private balcony overlooking east hill and Cornell. Has access to the shared hot tub and ample street parking. *to note* lower level tenants do have a young child. Quiet hours are asked to be after 9pm. There is some noise that is heard between the units. This custom built apartment has all the modern amenities you'd want and expect plus shared laundry in the house. Has central heat and AC. It's in my opinion the best apartment in Ithaca. Location, amenities and all modern conveniences.

Owner pays all utilities, trash, WiFi, snow removal, lawn care.","6","FOR_RENT","APARTMENT","false","false","false","false","false","false",,"42.442978",,"Conor Gaffney","415-360-6984",,,"Conor Gaffney",,,,,,"See listing website",,,"false","Source: Zillow Rentals","Listing Provided by","500","-76.50448",,,,,,,"110",,"https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c7490bed7ce7befbdaf5f936f395d065-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4080e53f5b42dd7c4dc5cbabc5583c66-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8877a266407dbd19b12f2ef0eb1348d4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e1ed24766ec8c249865b1051b55ccd6b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e800fe4f3f12cd3b8a9423f469960232-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/71e164612b1eeded1c831ff059934afe-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/31709aedee42e53b21417ba7562dab50-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b01d226c3fcd0bf614e4d4df146d8704-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/68a065f339dab3be36a5f0b02eacdecf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d8630b41969f0b4e43367c6311cabdc9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/03b62969fbc4778e09f1a35882c97c13-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Conor Gaffney",,"2200",,,"Zillow Rentals",,,"2023-10-11","Price change","true","2200","0.29411764705882354","4",,"false","Zillow Rentals","1696982400000",,"Zillow Rentals",,,,,,"2023-10-05","Price change","true","1700","-0.05555555555555555","3",,,,,,"false","Zillow Rentals","1696464000000",,"Zillow Rentals",,,,,,"2023-09-23","Listed for rent","true","1800","0","4",,,,,"false","Zillow Rentals","1695427200000",,"Zillow Rentals",,,,,,"2023-02-25","Listing removed","true",,"0",,,,,,"false","Zillow Rentals","1677283200000",,"Zillow Rentals",,,,,,"2023-01-30","Price change","true","1800","-0.1","4",,,,,"false","Zillow Rentals","1675036800000",,"Zillow Rentals",,,,,,"2023-01-26","Listed for rent","true","2000","0","4",,,,,"false","Zillow Rentals","1674691200000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2.11","1525","APPLY_NOW","19","16",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18 days","false","true","NONE","0","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/416-N-Plain-St-2-Ithaca-NY-14850/2059829117_zpid/",,,,"2059829117"

Open kitchen / living room floor plan. One covered parking space in carport. Private country setting on quiet road with creek on property. Walking distance to Trumansburg Rd. bus line. 2 minute drive to hospital / Cayuga Medical Center.

Naturally air conditioned in the summer, and since I pay for heat you can keep it as warm as you want in the winter. Decent soundproofing but you can still hear footsteps when right below them, so must be alright with a little noise. If you have music playing you shouldn't notice much noise from above.

Zero air flow between upstairs and apartment, if you are concerned about virus particles.

Furnished optional- I have some furniture if desired: queen size bed, kitchen table, couch

Owner lives upstairs: single dad with two kids here about half the time, and two border collies. Must be a dog lover, and your dog/cat is ok.

If you pay electricity/heat: $1050/mo. (still includes on-site laundry, wifi internet)
All utilities included: $1200/mo. (includes heat, electric, on-site laundry, wifi internet)

Move in cost: 1st month + one month security deposit = $2100 / $2400.

Become a part of Ithaca&apos;s history when you live in this building that has been officially designated as an Ithaca Landmark. This Italianate Mansion dating from the 1890s retains much of its original charm and character, including high ceilings, oak floors and trim, and carved fireplace mantels. The house is now configured into five unique apartments, with a laundry room and trash room in the basement, and a large parking lot that fits 38 vehicles. This fabulous Collegetown location is close to Cornell, yet just outside the main commercial blocks, adding desirable privacy and quietness to an otherwise crowded neighborhood. 
 
Each 2-bedroom apartment has a private ground-floor entrance, two bedrooms, and one bathroom. The modern kitchen is equipped with a dishwasher, microwave, oven, and refrigerator. The carpeted living room is furnished with a small sofa, arm chair, coffee table, and a dining table and chairs. There is also a 50&quot; mounted flat screen TV for tenants&apos; enjoyment. Each bedroom is fully furnished with a full sized bed, dresser, bookcase, desk, and chair.
 
Our leases are for twelve months. All of our properties are designated as non-smoking. The rent includes heat and hot water. Apartments are wired for cable and internet. Our full time maintenance staff is available 24 hours a day. Assigned parking is available for an additional fee.

If you're an adventurer at heart and crave the breathtaking beauty of lakefront living, this rental is tailor-made for you! Welcome to your oasis of tranquility, nestled in the heart of Ithaca, NY. Take heed, non-intrepid souls, for only those with a spirit of exploration need read on! 

Key Features: 
 Parking Note: A winding driveway and a ""mere"" 65 steps separate you from this lakeside haven. In snowy conditions, you may want to channel your inner explorer and park on the street, embarking on a picturesque trek to your abode. (Though, last year's absence of snow might have you questioning the whims of climate change!)

 Furnished Comfort: This cozy abode comes fully furnished, ensuring your move-in process is seamless and hassle-free. Unpack and unwind in a space designed for both relaxation and inspiration.

 Amazing Lakefront Location: Wake up to the melodious symphony of waves lapping against the shore and the sun casting its golden hues over the water. Sit and enjoy coffee on the deck, wander to the edge of the dock, congregate around the firepit at night, and embrace the ever-changing vistas as the lake's colors shift with the seasons.

 No Short-Term Renting or Subletting: This treasure trove of a dwelling is seeking a long-term companion from either November or December 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024 (negotiable to extend through May 18 if needed). If you're seeking a home to create memories, be inspired, and embrace the beauty of Cayuga Lake, you've come to the right place.

 Pricing: All these wonders can be yours for a monthly rent of $2550, offering incredible value for an experience that's truly priceless.

 No Pets: As much as we adore furry friends, our abode must remain a haven for those of us with severe allergies. Rest assured, though, that the beauty of the surroundings will more than compensate for this restriction.

Act Fast: Opportunities like this are as rare as the gems they represent. Embrace the call of the lake and secure your spot in this remarkable lakefront house. Contact Maureen for info about rental requirements and to schedule a visit. (Do not stop by without an appointment, the house is occupied.) Dive into the serenity, adventure, and charm that only lakefront living in Ithaca can provide!

Available to show starting in September. Tenants to pay for utilities (including gas and electric) and internet. Home is furnished, there are lots of blankets, towels, pillows, etc, and the kitchen is fully stocked. Grill and table/chairs for outdoor fun are included in rent. Two kayaks and one SUP (although lake temps are cold this time of year!) can be available. Available to rent either November or December through April. Negotiable to rent through May 18, 2024 at the latest. No pets, we have family members with severe allergies and we use the house part of the year. Tenant is to maintain yard, steps, driveway, etc. Exterior hose bibs to be turned/left off in winter. House is on septic, proper usage required. Lake homes in this area pull water from the lake. There is a chlorination system, but we recommend using bottled water for drinking. No smoking, no large parties (we live in a community and want to maintain good relations with neighbors). There is private parking and the lot was recently re-paved. Tenants should not use neighbor's yards or docks...our yard is a slice of heaven - there is really no need to go into the other yards, just want to make sure we mention it!
